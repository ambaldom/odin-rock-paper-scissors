Rock Paper Scissors Game

The project uses JavaScript and showcases the use of strings, variables, functions, numbers, and conditionals to create a game of Rock Paper Scissors. 

The first iteration of the game is five rounds and plays inputs from the user against automated plays from the computer.

The second iteration includes a button for the player's selection and is only one round.

The project showcases important soft skills such as problem solving, learning new concepts and applying them, and resourcefulness to find the right answers when the path forward isn't so clear.
